## Usage

Nach dem `composer-git-flow` so installiert ist stehen im globalen composer nun folgende Befehle zur verf√ºgung:

* `composer project:version` - Outputs the current version of the Git branch
* `composer project:releaseVersion` - Outputs the next release version of the current Git branch. Here to the version of the last release of the Git branch is determined and for the branches `main` and `support/[MAJOR].x` the minor version is incremented by one. For branches of the form `hotfix/[MAJOR].[MINOR].x` the patch level is incremented by one.
* `composer project:verifyRelease` - It is checked whether the current branch is releasable. For this it is added whether all dependencies were defined with a stable version.
* `composer project:startHotfix` - Creates a hotfix branch of the form `hotfix/[MAJOR].[MINOR].x` based on the current checked out level, where this should be a tag level. the Current tag level should always be the latest patch level of a given minor version. This version is determined and based on this version the Hotifx branch is named.
* `composer project:release` - Here the next release version of the current branch is determined and a tag of the form `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]` is created. Releases can be created for the branches `main`, `support/[MAJOR].x` and `hotfix/[MAJOR].[MINOR].x`.
